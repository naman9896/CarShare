              This graph shows the average of hours booked between ten different
              suburbs. Eveleigh has recorded 175 hours, which is followed by
              Sydney at 172 hours with some of the wonderful others being
              Haymarket and Rosebery. The mean findings indicate that the
              booking durations have been constant in all the marked suburbs.

            <p class="description">
              The graph used demonstrates that suburb hours are uniform in terms
              of quantity and average hours booked. Eveleigh and Sydney are
              leading slightly at nearly 175 hours, while other suburbs include
              Haymarket, and Rosebery and many others. The above trend shows the
              kind of booking durations that have been made in all the areas of
              operation.

              That is evident from the operator bookings depicted in the graph
              where, GoGet stood out at over 30,000. This is closely followed by
              other operators such as Car Next Door and Flexicar Hertz with less
              activity with Popcar and Uber Carshare barely apparent.

              If we focus on the average hours booked, then the graph represents
              the ‘Status’ where ‘Active’ took over 300 hours, followed by
              ‘Approved in Position’ and ‘Installed’. Application of lower
              averages is found for the pending statuses such as “Application”
              and “Unknown” due to less usage.

              From 2019 to 2022, the required hours can be seen to have some
              variations represented on the graph below. A mid-2020 dip is
              followed by peaks above 220 hours in 2021. Nevertheless, the
              variation stabilizes over time and this can be an effect of
              seasonality or some outside influence.

              The latter compares booked and available hours by suburb and shows
              substantial under-booking. Available hours are always over 700
              while the booked hours lie below 200 across the suburban precincts
              such as Stubbs and Bathurstr, Eveleigh, Haymarket and Zetland that
              could probably be utilised to the full.
