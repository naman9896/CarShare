            1. Expand Bays in High-Demand Suburbs on a Limited Scale
          </h3>
          <p class="insight-content animation_easy-top">
            <span>Insight: </span>High-demand suburbs like Potts Point and
            Darlinghurst show consistent booking needs.
          </p>
          <p class="recomm-content animation_easy-top">
            <span>Recommendation:</span> Start with a limited increase in bays
            in these areas, focusing on a small number of high-traffic
            locations. Rather than deploying entirely new infrastructure one
            should assess the feasibility of reallocating underused bays from
            low-demand suburbs to these areas which will help reducing setup
            costs.
          </p>

            <span>Insight: </span> Usage data shows seasonal trends with
            increased demand during warmer months.
          </p>
          <p class="recomm-content animation_easy-top">
            <span>Recommendation:</span> Implement a flexible strategy (like
            align, adapt and amplify) where additional bays are temporarily
            assigned to high-demand areas during peak seasons. Collaborate with
            operators to arrange temporary expansions, as needed, without
            committing to permanent increases. costs.

            <span>Insight: </span> Some operators achieve higher booking
            volumes, indicating strong customer preference.
          </p>
          <p class="recomm-content animation_easy-top">
            <span>Recommendation:</span> Strengthen collaboration with
            top-performing operators by exploring opportunities within existing
            contracts. Instead of restructuring contracts give more importance
            to incentives (e.g., performance bonuses) to motivate higher
            engagement in high-demand areas.

            commuter reliance on car sharing.
          </p>
          <p class="recomm-content animation_easy-top">
            <span>Recommendation:</span> Introduce commuter-focused subscription
            or loyalty programs that reward frequent weekday use. Structure this
            as an add-on to existing offerings, keeping implementation
            straightforward and minimizing changes to operations.
