          <p class="description">
            The two suburbs which followed the shortest commutes had the longest
            travel distances in the entire study; Surry Hills with 6 million and
            Darlinghurst at 4 million. This finds other suburbs such as Redfern
            and Pyrmont making a moderate contribution and other areas
            exhibiting considerably shorter average trip distance.

          <p class="description">
            The graph shows that the average trip distance by operator regarding
            Car Next Door and Uber Carshare is much higher than 1,400. Here
            Popcar and GoGet travelling nearly 1,000 and Flexicar-Hertz at 700,
            which include all the pick-ups and drop-offs.

          <p class="description">
            The qualitative relationship indicated on the scatter plot shows
            that as hours booked increases, so does the trip distance; most of
            the points lie within a range of less than 500 hours and 3000
            distance. Outliers are an identification of extra bookings and
            trips, which points out variation in booking occurrence.

        </h2>
        <div class="visual-card">
          <p class="description">
            The figure on scatter relatively indicates the hours booked against
            the number of bookings, most of the points are below the 500 hours
            50 bookings. Most of the top suburbs are mainly Concentrated in the
            Inner City suburbs like Surry Hills and Darlinghurst, while other
            dot show even less but very High Intensity of Booking within few
            suburbs.

        <div class="visual-card">
          <img src="../images/page-3/16.png" />
          <p class="description">
            Presenting the data as a chart, the number of bookings is reflective
            of the monthâ€™s average: December booked about 29. Scatter graph of
            three groups of students shows that their average monthly marks are
            higher in August, September, February and October but comparatively
            low in April and June. On balance, there is fairly constant demand
            and the main travel high season falls in December.

            The latter is depicted in the yearly average trips distance
            represented by approximately 980 until 2020 with a small increase in
            the first half of 2021. Rising to 2022, the figure surges
            considerably to reach above 1060, which may be as a result of
            shifting lifestyle, trends or preferences.
